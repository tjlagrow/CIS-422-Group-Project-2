Founded in 2017, Hopper's Heapin' Jalapenos is composed of several [contributors](https://github.com/tjlagrow/CIS-422-Group-Project-2/wiki/Contributors). 

Have you ever opened your fridge on an empty stomach, only to be discouraged to cook anything 
because, at a glance, you believe there's no way to make that hodgepodge of ingredients into 
something tasty? Be discouraged no more! Instead of having to go about the painstaking process 
of typing in every ingredient you have into some recipe website, the Jalapeños Team has developed 
this "SnackChat" app to let you expedite the process of building your list of ingredients so you
you can get straight to cooking!

How does this work? This app is a light-weight mobile and web-based platform that allows users to input images to 
generate recipes 

Please refer to [previous README](https://github.com/tjlagrow/CIS-422-Group-Project-1/blob/master/README.md) as a guideline.
